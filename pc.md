## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? Git branches are created in order to isolate specific Git commits from the rest of your main Git history
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? it lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? git switch - command
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch fetches the changes while git pull merges them after fetching. So in a way, git fetch is a part of git pull as it first fetches the changes and then performs git merge.
7. What is a merge conflict? an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes.
After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content.
The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command.
